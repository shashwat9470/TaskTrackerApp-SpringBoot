## Overview
The Task Tracker App is designed to simplify your day-to-day task management and ensure you stay organized and focused. 
With our intuitive and user-friendly interface, you can effortlessly track and prioritize your tasks, making your workday more productive and efficient.

## Features
* **User Registration :** Users can create an account to access the Task Tracker App.
* **Seamless Task Tracking :** As soon as you log into the app, you can easily add all the tasks you need to complete for the day. Each task is initially marked as pending, keeping you aware of what needs to be done.
* **Automated Reminders :** To help you stay on top of your tasks, the Task Tracker App sends you reminders via email every four hours for any pending tasks. This ensures that you never miss an important deadline or forget to complete a task.
* **Task Progress Monitoring :** As you work through your tasks, you have the power to mark them as done in the app. By doing so, you not only keep track of your progress but also eliminate further reminders for completed tasks. This feature saves you from unnecessary notifications and allows you to focus on the tasks that require your attention.
* **Daily Reset :** At midnight (12:00 AM), the Task Tracker App automatically clears all the tasks from the database. This daily reset gives you a fresh start every day, ensuring you begin each day with a clean slate and a clear mind.
